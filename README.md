Basically this mod allows to add non magic chars in TES Arena to use spell book + I think I kinda enabled flag for critical hit which shouldn't be a big problem.
Builded under DOS Box some old C++ or C compiler (not sure)


Also my original email for Nexus was on yandex.ua and after some political issues they migrated to ru/com domain and I am adding this description so Nexus mod can change domain and I will be able to move my account elsewhere)
